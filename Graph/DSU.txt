Sets which intersection is NULL are called DSU. 
Operations : 1. Combined two given sets(union) 2. Tell if two members belong to same set or not.(find)
also called union-find beacause it union and find are two operations which it supports.


int find(int i, vector<int>& parent)
{
   if(i == parent[i])
      return i;

    return find(parent[i], parent);
}
void union(int x, int y, vector<int> find)
{
   int x_parent = find(x, parent);
   int y_parent = find(y, parent);
   if(x_parent != y_parent)
   {
      parent[x_parent] = y_parent;
   }
}
